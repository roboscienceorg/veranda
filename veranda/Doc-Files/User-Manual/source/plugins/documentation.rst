Plugins Included with Veranda
=============================

One of the main advantages to the design of this project is that it can be 
extended through WorldObjectComponent Plugins and FileHandler Plugins. Unfortunately, 
because it is a ROS package, the project (and any such plugins) must be built with 
Ament and CMake. A number of plugins have been included with the project to provide 
basic functionalities, and those plugins can be used as examples of how other plugins 
should be set up; however, not all plugins will follow the same patterns, so this 
section will describe the existing plugins as well as some of the requirements to 
build and use a plugin. Each plugin documented here will have a table listing the properties they
expose, and some will also list ROS channels they can communicate on.

Shape Plugins
-------------

Shape plugins create a solid mass of a specific shape.

Rectangle Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Rectangle Plugin creates a rectangular shape. The width and height
can be specified.

can be specified.

==================   ==============   ============================

Polygon Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Polygon Plugin can be used to create a solid mass in any arbitrary shape, which could 
have holes in it. It is not intended to be added to objects manually, but should be used 
by other plugins to create specifically shaped masses. In the future, it may be 
possible to add a polygon and modify its points, but at the time of this writing, it is 
not possible. Finally, the components created by this plugin are anchored and will not 
move in the physics engine.

Design Details 
""""""""""""""

    #. The Box2D polygon type does not work properly with concave polygon and has a limitation on how many points can be in a polygon. To prevent either of these limitations from being a problem, the polygon is triangulated and all of the triangles are loaded as separate shapes. The triangulation algorithm is provided by the OpenGL GLU Tesselator.
    #. Polygons are simplified according to the straightness property setting. The simplification algorithm is the PSimpl implementation of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm found at `<http://psimpl.sourceforge.net/douglas-peucker.html>`_.
    #. Triangulation is performed each time the straightness property or one of the scaling properties changes.


Drive Plugins
-------------

Driving plugins produce force to propel a world object. Perhaps they would be better 
named 'propulsion plugins', but they usually emulate wheel-like hardware, so we're 
calling them driving plugins. Box2D does not actually simulate rolling of wheels in 
a top-down environment, so it is all done virtually. Given the size of a wheel and its 
angular velocity, we can calculate its linear velocity, and apply that velocity. 
Similarly, given its linear velocity, we can calculate the portions of that velocity 
in invalid directions and negate it (for example, to prevent a wheel from slipping or 
sliding).

It's important to note that, at least in the built-in plugins, the forces produced are 
proportional to the mass of the wheels. This means that if the body of a vehicle-like 
object is much more massive than the wheels, the wheels will have little effect on the 
object. This can be compensated for by allowing the user to tune the density of wheels 
so that their mass can be tweaked and made closer to the mass of what they are moving.

Omnidirectional Drive Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The omni drive plugin adds a new robot piece that can be used to propel the robot at defined velocity. The component
accpets the ros Pose2D message and interprets the values as meters/s in the x and y directions and rad/s. These values are then
used as the target velocities of the component in the in global coordinate frame. Omni drive components can also be configured
to publish the Pose2D message regularly. When published by the omni drive, this message should be interpereted
as the current velocity of the robot in the given directions. Think of the omni drive as a all that can roll in any
direction with the rest of the robot mounted above it.

Fixed Wheel Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fixed wheel plugin emulates a single wheel which cannot rotate to face a 
different direction. The wheel may be driven, which means its target angular 
velocity can be set and it will produce force in an attempt to travel the 
correct linear velocity. The wheel will always produce forces to negate any 
movement parallel to its axle (or where the axle would be if one existed).

Ackermann Steering Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ackermann steering plugin produces two linked wheels which can be steered 
together and will follow the Ackermann constraint. The wheels cannot be driven, 
they only produce forces to negate horizontal sliding, which can be used to 
steer a vehicle-like object.

Sensor Plugins
--------------

Sensors travel with a world object and collect information about the environment. 
This information is usually published to the control code through ROS messages so 
that the control code can react to what is happening. Sensors plugins should produce 
the same messages as their hardware counterparts so that any control code listening to 
the messages does not behave differently when the messages are produced by hardware.

GPS Receiver
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The GPS Sensor is used to return the current position of an object in the world. It publishes a ROS Pose2d message, which contains
X, Y, and Theta values. The sensor can be tuned to simulate a broken GPS which drops values, has noise, or drifts over time. The noise and drift values follow normal distributions, and the chance to drop values is uniform. When a value is dropped, NaN is published instead of the current coordinate or angle. Theta is published in radians. The properties exposed to set these 
distributions as well as specify the ROS topic can be found in table \ref{tab:gps_props}.

Touch Sensor Ring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The touch sensor ring plugin mimics a ring of touch sensors with a specific 
radius. It is intended to be used on circular robots, so that its radius can 
be set to the same as the robot. The sensor ring can be set to sense a specific 
section of the circle, and the number of sensors used can be specified. Whenever 
the state of one of the buttons changes, a ROS message is published. Extra 
circles are drawn on the world visualization to show which touch sensors are 
triggered.

Design Details

    #. All the required circle shapes for the touch sensors are generated at the start. They are added to and removed from the model when they become active or inactive.
    #. The touch sensor circle is a solid physics shape which can collide. This generates collision points from Box2D that can be used to know what is sensed.
    #. The body with the sensor ring fixture is held in place relative to the robot by a Box2D Weld Joint. The ring has a very low density (so as not to affect how the robot drives) so, due to the implementation of Weld Joints,  it is possible for the ring to behave in strange ways if it is larger than the robot it surrounds. Specifically, if there is a collsion and the robot continues to drive, the robot can be seen moving around within the touch sensor ring; it does not stay anchored in the center as one might expect.

Lidar Sensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The lidar sensor behaves as a regular hardware lidar would. It scans an area in 
front of (or around) itself at a high rate and reports the distances to the 
objects scanned. The lidar provided by this plugin can be customized to scan any 
size range from 0 to 360 degrees, with the center of the range directly in front 
of the lidar. The number of scan rays and the radius (maximum range) can also be 
specified, along with the rate of scanning. Each time a scan is performed, the 
image representing the lidar and its scan will be updated, and a ROS message 
will be published.

Wheel Encoders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wheel Encoders are sensors that are added as a part of the fixed-wheel plugin.
They cannot be used on any other type of wheel, but for all other purposes, they
behave just like any other component. Wheel encoders will publish the angular velocity
of the wheel they are attached to on a regular timer.

Image Loading Plugin
--------------------

One of the functions of the original STDR was that it could load an image, and then the dark pixels of the image would be treated as obstacles. This was 
simple for the STDR to do because of the way it did collision detection - on a per-pixel basis. Collisions in this project are done in the Box2D engine, 
so in order to provide a similar functionality, a plugin is included which converts an image to a set of obstacles which can be loaded into the physics engine. 
The plugin can handle the common image formats .png, .jpg, and .bmp. All images are converted to black and white before processing. A threshold is chosen by the 
user, and all pixels with an intensity above that are changed to 255 and all pixels with intensity at or below it are set to 0. When a file is loaded, the user is 
presented with a prompt in which they can specify the following:

    * Width and height of the image (meters)
    * Pixels per meter in both the horizontal and vertical directions
    * Straightness value for the shapes read
    * Greyscale threshold

If you load up an image and there are pieces missing or shaped incorrectly, try loading it again with different settings and you might have better luck.

    #. The triangulation and simplification necessary to load polygons into the physics engine is not done in the plugin, but in the polygon component type. Similarly, scaling is also done in the polygon component type.
	
JSON Plugin
-----------

One general-purpose file handler plugin is provided as part of the project. It is able format WorldObjects and WorldObjectComponents as JSON objects which can be 
stored in files. The JSON formatter can be used to save single World Objects and entire Simulations
